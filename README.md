# CNN for Genshin Impact Character Classification

This is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to classify images of characters from **Genshin Impact**! It draws inspiration from the elegant simplicity of **VGGNet**, integrating deep convolutional layers with modern image augmentation techniques for better generalization.

## Architecture Overview

This CNN model follows a VGG-inspired design with these magical components:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Stacked 3x3 convolutions with padding to preserve spatial resolution similar to what VGGNet has implemented. It begins with a `Conv2d` layer transforming the input image with 3 channels (RGB) into 32 feature maps.
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear ReLU activations are used to introduce non-linearity
- **Pooling Layers**: `MaxPool2d` layers reduce dimensionality while keeping the most important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: At the end of the convolutional journey, a few fully connected (dense) layers bring everything together to make the final prediction.

## Data Transformation

To increase the generalization capability of the model. Transformation were used to create slight variations in the image.These transformations are based on techniques used in the VGGNet paper

## Training Results

Due to the small size of the dataset, the same training data and testing data were used. This obviously over-represent the testing results - but here it is anyways.

## Further Improvements

This project is more of a curiosity project. It can be further improved with a larger dataset and better hyperparameters.
